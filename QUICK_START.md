docker push your-username/kube-credential:latest
```

## For Kubernetes Testing (Local)

### Using Minikube

```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start

# Build image in Minikube
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t kube-credential:latest .

# Deploy
kubectl apply -f k8s/

kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

# Get URL
minikube service kube-credential-issuance --url
```

## Submission Preparation (5 Minutes)

### 1. Update Contact Information

Edit `README.md` and replace:
- `[YOUR NAME HERE]` with your name
- `[YOUR EMAIL HERE]` with your email
- `[YOUR CONTACT NUMBER HERE]` with your phone number
- `[YOUR DEPLOYMENT URL HERE]` with your deployed app URL

### 2. Take Screenshots

Take screenshots of:
1. Successful credential issuance
2. Duplicate detection
3. Valid credential verification
4. Invalid credential verification
5. Test results (`npm test`)

Save them in the `screenshots/` folder.

### 3. Create Submission Package

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\prepare-submission.ps1
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x prepare-submission.sh
./prepare-submission.sh
```

Or manually create a zip file with:
- All source code
- Screenshots
- README.md
- Kubernetes manifests

### 4. Upload to Google Drive

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Delete database and retry
rm credentials.db
npm test
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Deployment Issues

**Render/Railway not starting:**
- Check logs in the platform dashboard
- Ensure `PORT` environment variable is set to 5000
- Verify build command completed successfully
- Check that all dependencies are installed

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Check TypeScript
npm run check
```

## API Test Examples (using curl)

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Issue credential
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/issuance/issue \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"credential": {"name": "Test User", "role": "Admin"}}'

# Verify credential
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/verification/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"credential": {"name": "Test User", "role": "Admin"}}'
```

## Time Estimate
