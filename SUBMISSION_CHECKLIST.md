- **Tests**: Run `npm test` to verify functionality
- **Local Testing**: Run `npm run dev` and test at `http://localhost:5000`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Tests failing
**Solution**: Delete `credentials.db` and run `npm test` again

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution**: Kill the process or use a different port

### Issue: Docker build fails
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

### Issue: Deployment URL not working
**Solution**: Check logs, verify environment variables, ensure PORT is set correctly

### Issue: Google Drive link not accessible
**Solution**: Right-click folder â†’ Share â†’ Change to "Anyone with the link"
