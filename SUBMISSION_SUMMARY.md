## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### System Design
```
Frontend (React) → Backend APIs (Express) → Database (SQLite)
                    ↓
            Issuance Service
            Verification Service
```

### Key Features

2. **Duplicate Detection**: SHA-256 hashing with key normalization
3. **Race Condition Handling**: Database-level unique constraints
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Zod validation
5. **Scalability**: Stateless design, Kubernetes-ready

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js 20, Express.js, TypeScript, SQLite
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Testing**: Vitest, Supertest
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Vite

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### 1. SQLite for Persistence
- **Why**: Lightweight, zero-config, perfect for free-tier deployments
- **Benefit**: Easy to deploy, no external database needed
- **Migration Path**: Can easily migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL later

### 2. SHA-256 Credential Hashing
- **Why**: Deterministic duplicate detection
- **Benefit**: Handles credentials with different key ordering
- **Security**: Prevents reverse engineering of stored credentials

### 3. Race Condition Handling
- **Why**: Concurrent requests could cause issues
- **Benefit**: Graceful handling at database level
- **Implementation**: Unique constraints + try-catch fallback

### 4. Monorepo Structure
- **Why**: Shared types between frontend and backend
- **Benefit**: Type safety across the stack
- **Developer Experience**: Single source of truth

### 5. Stateless Backend
- **Why**: Horizontal scalability
- **Benefit**: Each pod/worker is independent
- **Kubernetes**: Perfect for container orchestration

---

## 📈 Scalability Features

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless backend design
- Kubernetes HPA configured
- Load balancing ready
- Multiple replicas supported

### Performance
- Indexed database queries
- Efficient hashing algorithm
- Minimal dependencies
- Optimized build size

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoint
- Worker ID tracking
- Timestamp logging
- Error tracking

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Credential Hashing**: SHA-256 for storage
2. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all inputs
3. **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries
4. **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages
5. **CORS**: Configurable for production

---

## 📝 Assumptions Made

1. **Database**: SQLite suitable for MVP/free-tier
2. **Credential Format**: Any valid JSON with at least one field
3. **Worker Persistence**: Worker IDs per instance, not across restarts
4. **Key Ordering**: Credentials with different key orders are identical
5. **Authentication**: Not required for this assignment
6. **Single Database**: All workers share one database
